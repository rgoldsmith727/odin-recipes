  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The problem with the Whiskey Sour is, well, the sour part. I'm not a fan of lemon juice in whiskey cocktails...pretty much ever. It overpowers the nuances of whiskey with over-the-top sour notes. So my goal with this cocktail was to capture the bright, citrus notes of a proper Whiskey Sour without allowing the drink to succumb to acidity. The solution? Lemon zest and just a drop of lemon juice. The zest adds tons of aromatic notes, which makes us "taste" the lemon with our noses, yet doesn't allow the juice to bully the flavor of the finished cocktail.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lemon zest strip</li>
    <li>2 1/2 ounces bourbon</li> 
    <li>1/4 ounce agave or simple syrup</li>
    <li>Dash lemon juice</li> 
    <li>6 to 10 granules kosher salt</li>
    <li>Ice cubes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rub the zest strip around the rim of a rocks glass.</li>
    <li>Add the zest to the glass.</li>
    <li>In a cocktail shaker, combine the bourbon, syrup, lemon juice and salt.</li>
    <li>Shake with ice cubes.</li>
    <li>Add 1 large or 2 standard ice cubes to a rocks glass, then strain the cocktail into it.</li>
  </ol>
